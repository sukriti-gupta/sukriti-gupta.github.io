<p>
  I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology at UCLA working with Andrew Wikenheiser. For my thesis project, I am investigating orbitofrontal cortex sub-region contributions to value-based decisions in an open-field environment. I use movement data and large-scale electrophysiological recordings to understanding how ethologically relevant and non-stereotyped decisions in a continuous value space are represented and evaluated by the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex.

  Prior to graduate school, I was a post-baccalaureate researcher at UCLA with Andrew Wikenheiser. My project investigated the infuence of spatial predictability of reward location on goal representations in the orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus. Before my post-bacc, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Neuroscience from the University of British Columbia where I worked with Jeremy Seamans.
